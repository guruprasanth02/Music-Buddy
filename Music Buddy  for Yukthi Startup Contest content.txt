Problem Definition:

In today’s fast-paced world, traditional Indian classical music is fading among younger audiences due to lack of engaging learning tools. Beginners often find classical music intimidating and inaccessible. There is a pressing need for interactive, gamified platforms that make music education fun and emotionally resonant. Our project, Music Buddy – The Alankaar Game, addresses this gap by transforming classical music learning into a game-like experience using audio-visual cues, emotional mapping (Navarasa), and interactive tasks. It aligns with today’s digital-first learning culture and supports music institutions, museums, and ed-tech platforms in preserving and promoting cultural heritage.
